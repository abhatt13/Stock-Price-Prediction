# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using machine learning algorithms. It uses historical stock price data, processes it for analysis, and builds machine learning models to predict future prices. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps for multiple predictive models.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: The notebook demonstrates how to load stock market data and preprocess it by handling missing values, scaling data, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data using graphs and plots to understand trends and patterns.
- **Model Training**: Several models are trained, including linear regression, decision trees, and advanced models like LSTM (if applicable).
- **Prediction & Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using appropriate metrics, and predictions are compared with actual stock prices.
- **Visualization**: Prediction results are visualized using line charts and other plots.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (if using neural networks like LSTM)

You can install them using:
```bash
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```


## Data

The notebook uses historical stock price data. This data includes the following columns:

- **Date**: The date of the stock price record.
- **Open**: The price of the stock at the market opening.
- **Close**: The price of the stock at the market closing.
- **High**: The highest price the stock reached during the day.
- **Low**: The lowest price the stock reached during the day.
- **Volume**: The number of shares traded during the day.

The dataset can be sourced from external APIs such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or any other stock market data provider. You can also manually upload the dataset into the notebook if preferred. The notebook demonstrates how to load data from CSV files or via APIs.

## Usage Instructions

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Notebook**: Launch the notebook in Google Colab or your local Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. **Load the Data**: Ensure the stock price dataset is available and correctly referenced in the notebook. If using an API, ensure proper API key configuration.
3. **Run Preprocessing Steps**: Execute the data preprocessing steps to clean and normalize the data. This includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and other transformations.
4. **Model Training**: Train the stock price prediction models provided in the notebook. You can modify the hyperparameters and model configurations to experiment with different setups.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The notebook evaluates the trained models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and others. Review the evaluation results to assess the model performance.
6. **Prediction and Visualization**: Generate predictions for future stock prices and visualize them using the notebook's plotting functions.

## Example Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned by handling missing values, normalizing features, and transforming date features into usable formats for time series analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features such as moving averages, rolling statistics, or lag features are generated to improve model performance.
3. **Model Selection**: Train and evaluate models such as:
   - **Linear Regression**: A basic model to predict stock prices using historical data.
   - **Decision Trees**: A more advanced model that captures non-linear relationships in the data.
   - **LSTM (if applicable)**: A deep learning model suited for sequential time-series data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Use evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² to assess model performance.
5. **Visualization**: Plot the actual vs predicted stock prices for visual comparison and analysis.

## Results

The models trained in the notebook yield predictions for future stock prices. The evaluation of these models is based on accuracy metrics like:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in predictions, without considering their direction.
- **R² Score**: Indicates how well the model fits the data.

The notebook will also produce visualizations comparing predicted and actual stock prices, allowing for quick insight into model performance.

## Customization

The notebook is flexible and can be customized to fit different datasets or use cases:

- **Replace the dataset**: You can upload your own dataset or connect to a different stock market API.
- **Change the model parameters**: Modify hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, or tree depth for decision tree models to optimize performance.
- **Feature engineering**: Add or remove features based on your specific needs, such as additional technical indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Bollinger Bands.
